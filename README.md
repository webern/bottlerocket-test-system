# Bottlerocket Test System

A system for testing Bottlerocket.
To learn more about how it works, see the [design](design/DESIGN.md) document.

## Overview

The system consists of a command line interface, Kubernetes controller, custom resource definition (CRD) objects and containers that allow you to create resources and run tests.
You install TestSys into a cluster of your choice, we call this the *TestSys cluster*.
When running a test, resource agents create an external cluster where we run Bottlerocket instances and run tests.
This is called an *external cluster*.

### Project Status

ðŸš§ ðŸ‘·

The project is in active pre-release development.
We have begun publishing container images, but things aren't quite stable yet.
We also are not quite ready for external contributions, but we are happy to respond to issues and discussions.

### Versioning

We are using the same semantic version to represent all container images and crates.
Because we are iterating rapidly, we have started with [v0.0.1].
The published containers are tagged with the same version number that the git repo is tagged with.

[v0.0.1]: https://github.com/bottlerocket-os/bottlerocket-test-system/tree/v0.0.1

## Building and Running

In this example, we will use the `example-test-agent`, `example-resource-agent`, `controller` and `cli`.
This demonstrates the generic basics of the system without delving into the specifics of the Bottlerocket test agents.
To see how to use the system to test Bottlerocket images, check out `TESTING.md` in the [Bottlerocket GitHub repo].

After cloning, follow these instructions from the root of the git repo:

First we will build and tag the containers we need:

```shell
make controller example-test-agent example-resource-agent
```

<!--
```shell
export TESTSYS_DIR="$(pwd)"
```

Set a few more variables.
You might want to change the AWS region:

```shell
export TESTSYS_DIR="$HOME/repos/bottlerocket-test-system"
export TESTSYS_CLUSTER_NAME=testsys
export EKS_CLUSTER_NAME=external-cluster
export KUBECONFIG="/tmp/${TESTSYS_CLUSTER_NAME}.yaml"
export EKS_REGION="us-west-2"
export CARGO_HOME="${TESTSYS_DIR}/.cargo"
alias testsys="${TESTSYS_DIR}/.cargo/bin/testsys"
```

Install the `testsys` command line tool into the local CARGO_HOME and build the containers we need:

```shell
cd "${TESTSYS_DIR}"
cargo install --path "${TESTSYS_DIR}/testsys" --force

make controller
make ec2-resource-agent
make eks-resource-agent
make sonobuoy-test-agent

docker tag controller controller:eks
docker tag ec2-resource-agent ec2-resource-agent:eks
docker tag eks-resource-agent eks-resource-agent:eks
docker tag sonobuoy-test-agent sonobuoy-test-agent:eks
```

We will use a local `kind` cluster as our TestSys cluster.
Here we create it and load our container images into it using `kind`.
Note, the `kind load docker-image` command frequently reports an error even when everything seems to have worked.

```shell
kind create cluster --name "${TESTSYS_CLUSTER_NAME}"

kind load docker-image \
  controller:eks \
  ec2-resource-agent:eks \
  eks-resource-agent:eks \
  sonobuoy-test-agent:eks \
  --name "${TESTSYS_CLUSTER_NAME}"
```

Next we install the TestSys namespace, controller and CRD schemas into the TestSys cluster.
We also set our kubeconfig context to the testsys namespace for convenience.

```shell
testsys install --controller-uri controller:eks
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace="testsys-bottlerocket-aws"
```

We will be creating an EKS cluster and EC2 instances, so we need to create a Kubernetes secret with our AWS credentials.

```shell
testsys add secret map  \
 --name "aws-creds" \
 "access-key-id=$(aws configure get default.aws_access_key_id)" \
 "secret-access-key=$(aws configure get default.aws_secret_access_key)"
```

Now we are ready to run a Bottlerocket test.
We get the latest AMI ID.
Then we pass it to TestSys which will create an EKS cluster, launch Bottlerocket nodes and run a Sonobuoy test in 'quick' mode.

**Caution**: The command below specifies `never` as the `--cluster-destruction-policy`.
This is because creating a cluster takes a long time, and we might want to re-use it.
To delete the cluster manually, use `eksctl delete cluster "external-cluster"` or delete the relevant Cloudformation stacks.
You can also change the `--cluster-destruction-policy` to `onDelete` in the command below.
If you do, then when you `kubectl delete resource external-cluster`, the EKS cluster will be deleted.

```shell
K8S_VER="1.21"
REGION="us-west-2"
ARCH="x86_64"
VARIANT="aws-k8s-${K8S_VER}"
export AMI_ID=$(aws ssm get-parameter \
  --region "${REGION}" \
  --name "/aws/service/bottlerocket/${VARIANT}/${ARCH}/latest/image_id" \
  --query Parameter.Value --output text)

testsys run aws-k8s \
  --name "testsys-demo" \
  --test-agent-image "sonobuoy-test-agent:eks" \
  --keep-running \
  --sonobuoy-mode "quick" \
  --kubernetes-version "v${K8S_VER}" \
  --aws-secret "aws-creds" \
  --region "${REGION}" \
  --cluster-name "${EKS_CLUSTER_NAME}" \
  --cluster-creation-policy "ifNotExists" \
  --cluster-destruction-policy "never" \
  --cluster-provider-image "eks-resource-agent:eks" \
  --ami "${AMI_ID}" \
  --ec2-provider-image "ec2-resource-agent:eks"
```
-->

## Development

### Project Structure

- `model` is the root dependency.
It includes the CRDs and clients for interacting with them.

- `controller` contains the Kubernetes controller responsible for running resource and test pods.

- `agent` contains libraries with the traits and harnesses for creating test and resource agents.

- `bottlerocket` contains the implementations of the test and resource traits that we use for Bottlerocket testing.

- `cli` a CLI that can be used to install the controller, run tests, etc.

The `model`, `agents`, `controller` and `cli` crates are general-purpose, and define the TestSys system.
It is possible to use these for testing purposes other than Bottlerocket.

The `bottlerocket` and `tools` directories are more specialized to Bottlerocket's testing use cases.
